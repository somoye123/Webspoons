# Webspoons Full-Stack Challenge

A Full-stack application built with Ruby on Rails.
It uses Hotwire for ajax.
## About this project

This project was meant to evaluate and assess my current knowledge and skill level. Although no mockups was been provided, the interface and
functionality is meant to be clean, simple, and meet professional standards.
### Tasks

* = REQUIRED
ISBAT = “I should be able to”
ISNBAT = “I should not be able to”

● Create a simple index of users
● User attributes needed: Name*, Email*, Title, Phone*, Status(active, inactive)*, timestamps
● The column should be ordered: Last updated, Name, Email, Title, Phone, Status
● The text in the status column should be red if the status is “inactive” and green if the
status is “active”
● ISBAT create a new user
● ISBAT edit an existing user
● ISBAT delete an existing user
● Emails should be unique, ISNBAT create multiple users with the same email address.
● ISBAT sort columns by attributes
● ISBAT to filter users via a search field
● The index should contain at least 1000 users with seeded data.
● The index should be paginated with 25 users per page.
● The user should never need to leave or reload the index view. All forms should be in
modals and updates should update the table asynchronously.
● Assets should be configured correctly via webpacker.
